            You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
            world
            once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know
            exactly
            when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out.
            Now
            we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it
            wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
